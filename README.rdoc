Copyright (C) 2011 Consoci8 Sdn Bhd

The ExceptionEngine logs your Rails exceptions in your mongodb database and provides a web interface to manage them

It assumes you have mongodb installed and running in your machine


To use this in your rails engine, add the following line to your gemfile:

  gem "exception_engine"

And then run
  
  bundle install


Setup authentication:

Define an exception_engine_authentication method in ApplicationController:

  # app/controllers/application_controller.rb

  def exception_engine_authentication
    # authentication_logic_goes_here
  end


For example, if you are using the Devise gem and have an Admin model:

  # app/controllers/application_controller.rb

  def exception_engine_authentication
    authenticate_admin!
  end


View the exceptions interface:

  http://localhost:3000/exceptions




For mongo installation:

http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart

After you installed mongodb, make sure you run the mongod server

  $ mongod
